This is the beginning. I've been meaning to start writing for a while now, and here we are.

I'm Tripp — I build things at GoFundMe, hike whenever I can, and watch too much Bucks basketball. This site is where I'll write about all of it. Technology, the outdoors, and whatever else comes to mind.

No grand plan. Just putting thoughts somewhere.
